# Hamish Webpage
Description of Project Webpage: 

I originally started off with a completely different idea (to build a minimalistic webpage that had "hidden" information scattered around it; kind of a fun "treasure seeking" sort of idea). But that became way too complicated too quickly and I did not have the skillset to pull off that. 

This site was inspired by a music festival website I saw, that had big bold colours and really "in your face" sort of headlines. I also wanted it to be a fun, colorful sort of site that portrayed my interests in color, game design, etc. That's what I wanted to portray in this project. 

This webpage is particularly best viewed from a mobile view, but I think fits just as well in tablet and desktop modes. The screen sizes I believe are best for optional viewing are:

Mobile: 431 - 455 (best: 444)
Tablet: 737 - 931 (best: 870)
Desktop: 1200 - 1500 (1440)

In total, 17 commits were made (can be viewed under my webpage folder).

There are some small tweaks that can defintely be done, but overall i'm really happy with how I did on my first project.
