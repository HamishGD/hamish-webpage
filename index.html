        <span class="rotatingText-greeting">hello.</span>
        <span class="rotatingText-greeting">i like icecream.</span>
        <span class="rotatingText-greeting">strawberry is my favourite.</span>
        <span class="rotatingText-greeting">so i made my website look like one.</span>

    <!-- image of strawberry icecream, aiming to fade in and stay there after 
    last words "look like one" have come across the screen-->
    <div class="fade-in-icecream">
        <img src="./img/icecream.jpg" class="center">
    </div>

    <!-- next idea: to be able to click on different parts of the icecream and have
    text appear ONLY when you click on it (text can tell them different things about
    me - skills, education, experience)-->
